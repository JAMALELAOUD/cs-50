# cs-50
heey,
My name is Jamal, I'm from kenitra, Morocco and I'm computer science student at University Ibn tofail
So this is will be my final project for the CS50 <br>
<h4>title : homework organizer<h4>
I've used Django web framework based in Python along with sqlite3 as a backend for the website including Python libraries such Pillow to control the images,<br>
the front-end was bootstrap with some CSS , for upload files and forms extensions I used just django forms.<br>
<h3>Explaining the project and the database<h3><br>
My final project is a website that allow the student to upload and organize thier homeworks ,
I needed homework table for my database and I used forms inside upload template to upload new homeworks <br>
